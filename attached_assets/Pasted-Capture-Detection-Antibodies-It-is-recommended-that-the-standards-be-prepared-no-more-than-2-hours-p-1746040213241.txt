Capture/Detection Antibodies	It is recommended that the standards be prepared no more than 2 hours prior to performing the experiment. Use one 10 ng of lyophilized Mouse Klk1 standard for each experiment. Gently spin the vial prior to use. Reconstitute the standard to a stock concentration of 10 ng/ml using 1ml of sample diluent. Allow the standard to sit for a minimum of 10 minutes with gentle agitation prior to making dilutions.
Specificity	Natural and recombinant Mouse Klk1
Standard Protein	It is recommended that the standards be prepared no more than 2 hours prior to performing the experiment. Use one 10 ng of lyophilized Mouse Klk1 standard for each experiment.
